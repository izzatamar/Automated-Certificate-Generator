# Automated-Certificate-Generator
This project was done during my internship at NFE Consulting Sdn Bhd. The project was launched with the intention to cut down processing time in generating certificates. This project is written in Python. The program connects to FTP Server, accesses the sales record and transforms it into a certificate.
